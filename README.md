# üìû PaCT ID - Personal and Cheap International Dialling

**PaCT ID** is a Twilio-powered local-to-international calling bridge. It allows you to call and receive calls across borders using local Twilio numbers while preserving caller IDs ‚Äî with a handy PWA frontend for mobile dialing.

<summary>What does PaCT ID stand for?</summary>

**P**robably **C**heaper **T**o **I**nternationally **D**ial

Ironically, it's actually much cheaper. From 'research', Leo found that it costs like ¬£0.025 per minute going from a UK -> US, and his data plan is like ¬£0.13 a minute, so _big savings_.

Someone's probably going to reverse engineer my server and find all my numbers, so it'll end out to be more expensive when they f me with twilio bills.

## üåç How It Works

- **Inbound Calls from Others**  
  - If someone calls your **US Twilio number**, it's forwarded to your **UK personal number** via your **UK Twilio number**, showing the original US caller ID.
  - If someone calls your **UK Twilio number**, it's forwarded to your **US personal number** via your **US Twilio number**, showing the original UK caller ID.

- **Outbound Calls from You**  
  - If _you_ call the **UK Twilio number**, you're prompted to enter a number (e.g., a US number) [then press hash], and it connects using your **US Twilio number**, showing your personal UK number as caller ID.
  - If _you_ call the **US Twilio number**, you're prompted to enter a number (e.g., a UK number) [then press hash], and it connects using your **UK Twilio number**, showing your personal US number as caller ID.

## üîß Installation

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leowilkin/pactid.git
cd pactid
```

### 2. Set up virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create a `.env` file

```bash
nano .env
```

[See example](https://github.com/leowilkin/pactid/blob/main/.env.example)

### 4. Create systemd Service

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/twilio.service
```

<summary>In development</summary>


In that crispy new file, paste [this weird ass code](https://github.com/leowilkin/pactid/blob/main/systemd/python.ini) in, and apparently it makes it run automatically which is pretty neat.

Then hit it with an enable & start

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable twilio
sudo systemctl start twilio
```

<summary>In production</summary>


"Apparently" using Flask servers in prod isn't such a good idea, so when you're running it for realsies, use [this systemd file](https://github.com/leowilkin/pactid/blob/main/systemd/gunicorn.ini)

Then hit it with an refresh

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl refresh twilio
```
</details>



## üåê Configure Cloudflare Tunnel

1. Go to [dash.cloudflare.com](dash.cloudflare.com), and enter Zero Trust
2. Networks > Tunnels
3. Create a new tunnel > Cloudflared > name your tunnel
4. Debian > 64-bit
5. Copy and paste the install code into your terminal
6. Once completed, copy and paste the activation code into your terminal
7. Next > configure public hostname as twilio.yourdomain.com, and save

## üîÅ Configure Twilio Webhooks

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You cannot be on a trial account, as you have to have two numbers.

Set the following webhook URLs for your Twilio numbers:

| Number Type |               Webhook URL              |
|-------------|:--------------------------------------:|
| US Number   | https://twilio.yourdomain.com/voice_us |
| UK Number   | https://twilio.yourdomain.com/voice_uk |

These should be set as the Voice & Fax > A Call Comes In handler (Webhook + TwiML).

## Extra Features!

Set your MOTD to a custom Linux PaCT ID message so you can remember all those commands easily!

Simply:

```bash
nano /etc/motd
```

and paste:

```bash
üëã You're logged into $(hostname), your PaCT ID server!

Useful commands:

- systemctl stop twilio
- systemctl start twilio && journalctl -u twilio.service -f
- systemctl status twilio
- nano /opt/twilio/bridge.py

Fully reload & restart?

1. sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
2. sudo systemctl daemon-reload
3. sudo systemctl restart twilio.service
